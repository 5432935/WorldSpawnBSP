# WorldSpawnBSP
AIR ver 18.0 Away3D extension for rendering custom BSP content. My other project BSPUtility needs to be run on a BSP ver 29 to create the converted BSP this project utilizes. 

This project relies on the FZIP package (@ http://codeazur.com.br/lab/fzip/) and Away3D 4.1.6 (@ http://away3d.com/)
